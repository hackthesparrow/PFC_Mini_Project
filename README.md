📌 Project Overview

The Marks Grading and Total Calculation System is a console-based application developed using the C programming language.
This program takes marks of multiple subjects from the user, calculates the total marks, computes the percentage, and assigns a grade based on predefined percentage criteria.

This project is beginner-friendly and focuses on understanding how basic C programming concepts work together to solve a real-life academic problem.

🎯 Why This Project Was Created

This project was created to:

Understand the use of loops for repeated input and calculations

Learn how to use arrays to store multiple values

Practice arithmetic operators for total and percentage calculation

Implement conditional statements (if-else) for grade assignment

Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills

Learn how to take user input and display structured output

⚙️ Features of the Project

Accepts marks for multiple subjects dynamically

Calculates:

Total Marks

Percentage

Grade

Uses loops for input and total calculation

Uses conditional statements for grading logic

Clean, readable, and beginner-friendly code

Console-based output with clear results

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Compiler: GCC

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code

Platform: Windows (Command Line Interface)

🚀 How the Project Works

The user enters the number of subjects.

Marks for each subject are entered using a loop.

All marks are stored in a 1D array.

A loop calculates the total marks.

Percentage is calculated using the formula:

Percentage = (Total Marks / Maximum Marks) × 100


Grades are assigned using if-else conditions based on percentage.

The program displays total marks, percentage, and grade clearly on the screen.

📊 Sample Output
Enter number of subjects: 5
Enter marks of subject 1: 75
Enter marks of subject 2: 80
Enter marks of subject 3: 68
Enter marks of subject 4: 90
Enter marks of subject 5: 85

Total Marks = 398
Percentage = 79.6%
Grade = B

📈 Utility of the Project

Helps students understand core C programming concepts

Useful for academic practicals and mini projects

Reduces manual calculation errors

Saves time during result preparation

Can be used as a base model for:

🔮 Future Scope of the Project

This project can be further enhanced in the future by:

Adding support for more subjects dynamically

Storing student details using file handling or databases

Creating a menu-driven result management system

Implementing GPA / CGPA calculation

Developing a GUI-based or web-based version

Integrating the system with school or college management software

📚 What I Learned from This Project

While developing this project, I learned:

How to use loops for repeated input and calculations

How to use arrays to store and manage multiple values

How arithmetic operators are used for calculating totals and percentages

How conditional statements help in decision making

How to design a program in a step-by-step structured manner

How to take user input and display formatted output properly

🙌 Conclusion

The Marks Grading and Total Calculation System is a simple yet effective project that demonstrates how loops, arrays, arithmetic operators, and conditional statements work together in C programming.
This project strengthens the foundation of C language concepts and prepares students for more advanced programming and academic projects.
